## Writing about history
(Writing about) history is a matter of exclusion, rather than inclusion of details.
> One of the biggest challenges for a writer of nonfiction is to avoid using too much of his or her hard-won material. **A great and enduring book isn’t comprehensive; it is highly, even ruthlessly, selective, <mark>zeroing in on the most evocative and illustrative moments while dispensing with the clutter</mark>** that might prevent the high points from resonating to maximum effect.

## Leading Teams
Manage individual strengths, weaknesses and temperament to keep group productivity and attitudes high, especially in difficult situations
> Though he was virtually fearless in the physical sense, he suffered an almost pathological dread of losing control of the situation. In part, this attitude grew out of a consuming sense of responsibility. He felt he had gotten them into their situation, and it was his responsibility to get them out. As a consequence, **he was intensely watchful for potential troublemakers who might nibble away at the unity of the group.**

> And Shackleton was not sure that Crean’s rough, tactless nature would lend itself well to a period of enforced and perhaps long waiting. McNeish was now fifty-seven years old, and really not up to the journey. But both Shackleton and Wild felt that he was still a potential troublemaker and not a good man to be left behind.

>  Shackleton knew it—and yet there was no choice. He made his announcement after breakfast, and all of the men accepted it routinely and without question.


In high-volatility or high-risk situations, prioritise speed of decision-making over preparedness
> From studying the outcome of past expeditions, he believed that **those that burdened themselves with equipment to meet every contingency had fared much worse than those that had <mark>sacrificed total preparedness for speed.</mark>**

## Personal satisfaction
Personal satisfaction comes more from purpose than from the environment
> There was even a trace of mild exhilaration in their attitude. **At least, they had a clear-cut task ahead of them.** The nine months of indecision, of speculation about what might happen, of aimless drifting with the pack were over. Now they simply had to get themselves out, however appallingly difficult that might be.

> **But sufficiently provoked, there is hardly a creature on God’s earth that ultimately won’t turn and attempt to fight, regardless of the odds.** In an unspoken sense, that was much the way they felt now. They were possessed by an angry determination to see the journey through—no matter what. They felt that they had earned it.
